  # Choose what kind of storage to use for this uploader:
  #storage :file
  # storage :fog

  # Override the directory where uploaded files will be stored.
  ## This is a sensible default for uploaders that are meant to be mounted:

  # def default_url

  # process :scale => [200, 300]
  #

  #   # do something
  # end

  # Create different versions of your uploaded files:
  # version :thumb do
  #   process :scale => [50, 50]
  # end

  # Add a white list of extensions which are allowed to be uploaded.
  # For images you might use something like this:
  # def extension_white_list
  #   %w(jpg jpeg gif png)
  # end

  # Override the filename of the uploaded files:
  # Avoid using model.id or version_name here, see uploader/store.rb for details.
