MyWebRoom App on RoR

******************
Environment variables
******************
Environment variables are on the
    config/application.yml

******************
Json method
******************
  all the json methods for the API start with json...
  the second word must be the action (standard on rails)
      show      = get one
      index     = get many
      create    = post
      update    = put
      destroy   = delete

  the following words we should follow the name and conventions of ruby

  eg json_show_user_by_email/gabriel@gmail.com
